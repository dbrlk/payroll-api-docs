## Relationships

### BelongsTo Relationships
- `site` - The site this employee belongs to
- `user` - The user who created this employee
- `company` - The company this employee works for

### HasMany Relationships
- `documents` - All documents associated with this employee

## Security Considerations

1. SSN Protection
- SSN is always masked in responses (XXX-XX-1234 format)
- Full SSN is only visible during creation
- SSN is encrypted at rest in the database
- SSN is transmitted securely via HTTPS

2. Access Control
- Users can only access employees within their site
- Company-level permissions restrict access to employees
- Audit logs track all employee data access

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes

- 401 Unauthenticated
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
  ```

- 403 Unauthorized
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You are not authorized to access this employee."
}
  ```

- 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Employee not found."
}
  ```

- 422 Validation Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "The given data was invalid.",
  "errors": {
    "email": ["The email field is required."],
    "ssn": ["Invalid SSN format."]
  }
}
  ```

## Best Practices

1. Data Validation
- Always validate SSN format (XXX-XX-XXXX)
- Verify email format and uniqueness
- Validate phone numbers for proper format
- Ensure address fields follow standards

2. Security
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor failed access attempts
- Regular security audits

3. Performance
- Use sparse fieldsets for large datasets
- Include only needed relationships
- Implement proper indexing
- Cache frequently accessed data

4. Compliance
- Follow data privacy regulations
- Implement data retention policies
- Maintain audit trails
- Regular compliance reviews
