Employees are individuals associated with companies in the system. Each employee can have multiple documents (paystubs, W2s, etc.) linked to their profile. All employee operations require authentication.

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

## Security Considerations

1. SSN is always masked in responses (XXX-XX-1234 format)
2. Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
3. Access is restricted by company and site
4. Full SSN is only visible during creation/update

## Error Handling

- 401 Unauthenticated - Invalid or missing token
- 403 Unauthorized - Insufficient permissions
- 404 Not Found - Employee does not exist
- 422 Validation Error - Invalid input data

## Best Practices

1. Always validate SSN format (XXX-XX-XXXX)
2. Use proper country codes (ISO 2-letter)
3. Keep employee information up to date
4. Handle personal data in compliance with privacy laws
