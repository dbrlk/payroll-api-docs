Documents represent various payroll-related files such as paystubs, W2s, 1099s, and invoices. Each document is associated with an order and can be linked to a company and/or employee. Documents go through a processing lifecycle and require authentication to access.

## Document Processing Lifecycle

1. Document is created as part of an order
2. Initial status is `Pending`
3. Background job picks up the document
4. Status changes to `Processing`
5. Content is processed using template
6. PDF file is generated and stored
7. Status updates to `Completed` or `Failed`
8. Document becomes available for download if completed

## Relationships

- **Order**: Each document belongs to an order
- **Company**: Document can be associated with a company
- **Employee**: Document can be associated with an employee
- **User**: Document belongs to the user who created the order
- **Site**: Document belongs to a specific site

## Error Handling

- 401 Unauthenticated - Invalid or missing token
- 403 Unauthorized - Insufficient permissions
- 404 Not Found - Document does not exist
- 422 Validation Error - Invalid input data

## Best Practices

1. Always check document status before download
2. Store document UUIDs for future reference
3. Handle processing errors gracefully
4. Monitor document status changes
5. Implement proper retry mechanisms
6. Follow document type-specific content guidelines
7. Use appropriate filters to find documents efficiently
