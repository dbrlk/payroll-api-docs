title: 'Including Relations'
description: 'Learn how to include related resources in API responses'
---

The API supports including related resources in responses using Spatie Query Builder v6. This helps reduce the number of API calls needed to fetch related data.

## Basic Usage

Use the `include` parameter to specify related resources:

```bash
# Include company's employees
curl https://api.paystub.dev/companies?include=employees

# Include document's company and employee
curl https://api.paystub.dev/documents?include=company,employee
```

## Available Includes

### Companies
- `employees`
- `documents`

### Employees
- `company`
- `documents`

### Documents
- `company`
- `employee`

## Nested Relations

Include nested relations using dot notation:

```bash
# Include employee's company and its documents
curl https://api.paystub.dev/employees?include=company.documents
```

## Multiple Relations

Combine multiple includes with commas:

```bash
# Include both company and documents for employees
curl https://api.paystub.dev/employees?include=company,documents
```

## Combining with Other Features

Includes can be used with filtering, sorting, and pagination:

```bash
curl https://api.paystub.dev/companies?\
include=employees,documents\
&filter[status]=active\
&sort=-created_at\
&page=1
```

## Response Format

When including relations, they appear as nested objects:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Acme Inc",
    "created_at": "2024-01-28T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-28T12:00:00Z",
    "employees": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "created_at": "2024-01-28T12:00:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-01-28T12:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "Paystub",
        "status": "Completed",
        "created_at": "2024-01-28T12:00:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-01-28T12:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **N+1 Query Prevention**: Includes are optimized to prevent N+1 queries using eager loading

2. **Selective Loading**: Only request relations you need:
```bash
# Good: Specific include
curl https://api.paystub.dev/companies?include=employees

# Better: Include with specific filters
curl https://api.paystub.dev/companies?include=employees&filter[status]=active
```

3. **Limit Nesting Depth**: Deep nesting can impact performance:
```bash
# Avoid deep nesting
curl https://api.paystub.dev/companies?include=employees.documents.company.employees
```

## Best Practices

1. Only include necessary relations
2. Use filters with includes to limit data size
3. Consider pagination when including one-to-many relations
4. Cache responses with includes when possible
5. Monitor query performance with includes

## Error Handling

Invalid includes will return a 422 error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid include parameter",
  "errors": {
    "include": ["The included relationship [invalid] is not allowed."]
  }
}
```

## Count Relations

You can also get the count of relations without loading them:

```bash
# Get companies with employee and document counts
curl https://api.paystub.dev/companies?include=employees_count,documents_count
```

This will return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Acme Inc",
    "employees_count": 5,
    "documents_count": 10
  }
}
```
