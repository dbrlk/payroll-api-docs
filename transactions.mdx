Transactions represent payment records in the system. Each transaction is associated with an order and tracks payment processing details. All transaction operations require authentication.

  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "amount": 299.99,
  "reason": "Customer request"
}'
  ```

  ```json Response

  curl -X POST https://api.paystub.dev/transactions/1/void \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"
  ```

  ```json Response
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "VOIDED",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-28T12:30:00Z"

  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Relationships

### BelongsTo Relationships
- `site` - The site this transaction belongs to
- `user` - The user who initiated the transaction
- `order` - The order associated with the transaction

## Transaction Types

1. Sale
- Standard payment transaction
- Creates a new charge
- Requires payment details or saved card

2. Refund
- Refunds a previous sale
- References original transaction
- Can be partial or full amount

3. Void
- Cancels a pending transaction
- Must be within processor timeframe
- No financial impact

4. Free
- Zero-amount transaction
- Used for free orders
- No payment processing needed

## Transaction Status Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PENDING] --> B[PROCESSING]
    B --> C[COMPLETED]
    B --> D[FAILED]
    C --> E[REFUNDED]
    A --> F[VOIDED]
```

## Security Considerations

1. Payment Data Protection
- Payment details are never stored
- Processor tokens are short-lived
- All amounts are validated
- Response data is sanitized

2. Access Control
- Transactions are site-scoped
- Refunds require special permissions
- Void operations are time-limited
- Full audit trail is maintained

3. PCI Compliance
- No card data in logs
- Secure token transmission
- Regular security scans
- Employee training required

## Error Handling

  }
}
  ```

### Processor-Specific Errors
