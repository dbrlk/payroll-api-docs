## Overview

Welcome to The Avenues LLC's Payroll Service API documentation. This API serves as the unified backend for three major payroll service websites:

- [PaystubsNow.com](https://paystubsnow.com)
- [CheckstubMaker.com](https://checkstubmaker.com)
- [TheBestPaystubs.com](https://thebestpaystubs.com)

Our API implements modern architecture patterns to handle multi-tenant requests efficiently. Each request is automatically scoped to its originating site, ensuring data isolation and security.

## Getting Started

Our API is designed to be simple to use with automatic site detection based on the requesting domain. Here's how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Domain">
    Ensure your requests come from your authorized domain (paystubsnow.com, checkstubmaker.com, or thebestpaystubs.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Development Setup">
    Use our staging environments for development and testing before moving to production
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    No API key needed - just make your HTTP request from your authorized domain and we'll handle the rest
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Architecture

Our API follows REST principles for consistent request and response handling. Key architectural features include:

- **Multi-tenancy**: Automatic request scoping based on the originating domain
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to ensure fair usage
- **Query Builder**: Powered by Spatie's Query Builder package for flexible data querying

## API Versioning

There is currently no versioning in the API. If versioning is implemented in the future, it will start from `v2`.

```bash
https://psn-api.avenues.dev/{endpoint}
https://csm-api.avenues.dev/{endpoint}
https://tbp-api.avenues.dev/{endpoint}
```
